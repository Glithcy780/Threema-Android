<p>curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function</p>
<p>http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/</p>
<p>Adam Langley agl@imperialviolet.org</p>
<p>Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein
djb@cr.yp.to</p>
<p>More information about curve25519 can be found here
http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</p>
<p>djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special
assembly language called qhasm and uses the floating point registers.</p>
<p>This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519
paper. It uses many of the tricks described therein. Only the crecip
function is taken from the sample implementation.</p>
