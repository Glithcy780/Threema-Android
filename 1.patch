-and report it to us via Threema or by encrypted email, we will try to respond
-as quickly as possible. You can find the contact details at
-[threema.ch/contact](https://threema.ch/contact) (section "Security").
-
-
-## <a name="release-policy"></a>Source Code Release Policy
-
-This source code repository will be updated for every public non-beta release.
-There will be one commit per released version.
-
-Commits are signed using PGP. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more
-information.
-
-
-## <a name="license-checks"></a>License Checks
-
-While the source code for Threema for Android is published under an open source
-license, Threema is still a paid app. To run the app in combination with our
-official server infrastructure, you must have bought a license either on Google
-Play or in the Threema shop.
-
-The app uses four different license check types, depending on the build variant:
-
-### Google Play Licensing
-
-When creating a new Threema ID using the Threema app bought on Google Play, the
-app sends a [LVL license verification token](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/)
-to the directory server. This allows the server to verify that you have indeed
-bought the app, without being able to identify you.
-
-This means that a self-compiled app using the `google` build variant cannot be
-used to create a new Threema ID. You can, however, use an app that was
-purchased over Google Play to create an ID and then export a backup. This
-backup can then be imported into the self-compiled app.
-
-Note that the ID creation endpoint is monitored for abuse.
-
-### Huawei HMS Licensing
-
-When creating a new Threema ID using the Threema app bought on Huawei AppGallery, the
-app sends a [Huawei DRM Signature](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/appgallerykit-paidapps-devguide-0000001073913394)
-to the directory server. This allows the server to verify that you have indeed
-bought the app, without being able to identify you.
-
-This means that a self-compiled app using the `hms` build variant cannot be
-used to create a new Threema ID. You can, however, use an app that was
-purchased over Huawei AppGallery to create an ID and then export a backup. This
-backup can then be imported into the self-compiled app.
-
-Note that the ID creation endpoint is monitored for abuse.
-
-### Threema Shop Licensing
-
-If you bought a Threema for Android license in the [Threema Shop](https://shop.threema.ch/),
-you have received a license key. This license key can be used for license
-verification in the `store_threema` build variant.
-
-### Threema Work
-
-If you build the `work` build variant, credentials from the [Threema
-Work](https://work.threema.ch/) subscription must be provided in order to use
-the app.
-
-### Allowlist
-
-The `none` build variant is used for development. It can only be used to create
-new Threema IDs if the random Device ID has been put on an "allow list" by a
-Threema employee.
-
-
-## <a name="build-variants"></a>Build Variants
-
-**Consumer**
-
-There are currently the following product flavors relevant for the consumer
-version of Threema:
-
-| Flavor                 | Description                                    | License Checks |
-| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
-| `store_google`         | Google Play Store version (regular, paid app)  | Google Play    |
-| `hms`                  | Huawei AppGallery version (regular, paid app)  | Huawei HMS     |
-| `store_threema`¹       | Threema Shop version (with play services)      | Threema Shop   |
-| `fdroid`¹              | F-Droid version (no proprietary code)          | Threema Shop   |
-
-For local testing, we recommend building the `store_google` or `store_threema`
-build variants.
-
-¹ The main difference between `store_threema` and `fdroid` is that the former
-  contains proprietary push services and a self-updater while the latter does
-  not. Additionally, the `fdroid` version will use your system emoji, instead
-  of bundling emoji graphics.
-
-
-**Threema Work / OnPrem**
-
-Additionally, these build variants are only relevant for Threema Work or
-Threema OnPrem customers:
-
-| Flavor               | Description                                    | License Checks |
-| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
-| `store_google_work`  | Google Play Store version (work, free app)     | Threema Work   |
-| `hms_work`           | Huawei AppGallery version (work, free app)     | Threema Work   |
-| `onprem`             | Threema OnPremises version                     | Threema Work   |
-
-**Internal Development**
-
-The following variants are only used for development and testing within Threema:
+This version has his own push messages service. No need for any g**gle push server :))
 
-| Flavor               | Description                                    | License Checks |
-| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
-| `none`               | Used for development                           | Allowlist      |
-| `sandbox`            | Uses sandbox test environment¹                 | Allowlist      |
-| `sandbox_work`       | Uses sandbox test environment¹                 | Threema Work   |
-| `red`                | Uses sandbox test environment¹                 | Threema Work   |
 
-¹ *The "sandbox" is a backend test environment that is used for internal testing
-  at Threema. The sandbox backend can currently not be accessed from the public
-  Internet.*
-
-
-## <a name="building"></a>Building
-
-Before building the app, please read the "Build Variants" section above. For
-local testing, we recommend building and running the `store_google` or
-`store_threema` build variant.
-
-### Via Command Line
-
-Prerequisites:
-
-- Android SDK
-- Android NDK
-- bash shell
-
-The application APK can be built using Gradle Wrapper:
-
-    # Play Store variant
-    ./gradlew assembleStore_googleDebug
-
-    # Threema Store variant
-    ./gradlew assembleStore_threemaDebug
-
-*NOTE:* Threema for Android is developed on Linux machines, we cannot offer any
-assistance for building on macOS, Windows, or other operating systems.
-
-### Via Android Studio
-
-The project can be imported into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
-To build and deploy it to a device, click the green "Play" icon.
-
-
-## <a name="testing"></a>Testing
-
-### Via Command Line
-
-To run unit tests:
-
-    ./gradlew testNoneDebug
-
-To run integration tests (with a device or emulator attached):
-
-    ./gradlew connectedNoneDebugAndroidTest
-
-Note that integration tests run in the same app environment as your "real" app,
-so data loss is possible. For example, if an integration test deletes your
-Threema ID in order to test the backup restoration process, the Threema ID in
-your "real" app may also be gone (if it was signed with the same signing key).
-It is best to only run integration tests on a non-productive device or in an
-emulator.
-
-### Via Android Studio
-
-You can also run tests through Android Studio.
-
-
-## <a name="reproducible-builds"></a>Reproducible Builds
-
-Instructions on how to reproduce the build process used to publish the official
-Threema app can be found at
-[threema.ch/open-source/reproducible-builds/](https://threema.ch/open-source/reproducible-builds/).
-
-
-## <a name="architecture"></a>Code Organization / Architecture
-
-Before digging into the codebase, you should read the [Cryptography
-Whitepaper](https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf)
-to understand the design concepts.

-encrypting messages, etc.) can be found in the
-`domain/src/main/java/ch/threema/` directory.
-
-The code of the actual Android app is located in the
-`app/src/main/java/ch/threema/` directory.

 <p>curve25519-donna: Curve25519 elliptic curve, public key function</p>
-
 <p>http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/</p>
-
 <p>Adam Langley agl@imperialviolet.org</p>
-
-<p>Derived from public domain C code by Daniel J. Bernstein djb@cr.yp.to</p>
-
-<p>More information about curve25519 can be found here http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</p>
-
-<p>djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly language called qhasm
-    and uses the floating point registers.</p>
-
-<p>This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It uses many of the
-    tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken from the sample implementation.</p>
